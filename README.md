⚡ Power Load Type Prediction System

An end-to-end AI application that predicts power system load conditions (Light, Medium, Maximum) using machine learning and a Streamlit web interface.

Project Overview

Power system load prediction is crucial for efficient energy planning, system reliability, and reducing operational risks.
This project builds a machine learning model that predicts the load type of a power system using historical energy usage, reactive power, environmental, and time-based features.

The trained model is deployed as a real-time Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.
🚀 Features

✔ Predicts Light / Medium / Maximum Load
✔ Time-aware ML model
✔ Handles class imbalance
✔ Dark themed modern UI
✔ Real-time prediction using Streamlit
✔ Production-ready serialized model
